# Rumi

> The deployed version wouldn't work right now as qwik deploys on edge - and pusher http package does not support edge or any other runtime other than Node. There are a few instance(s) where polyfill isn't helping. I am currently discussing this, and would update the repo once it has been resolved / I work on a work-around :)

~ Rumi is a smol app for discussion room(s) which I made to tinker around with [Qwik Framework](https://qwik.builder.io/).

The idea was pretty simple, during college practical labs, me and my friends like to play [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/), and the custom room links are too big to type and everyone makes a typo atleast once :(

The idea here is simple, Join a room -> send the link -> click on the link -> boom, enjoy
